Automated Virtual Personal Assistant is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual.

It engages the user in a friendly two-way conversation to helping you with simple tasks like setting a reminder to even more complicated tasks such as WhatsApp Automation.

Digital assistants are intelligent enough to understand the context of a query and deliver corresponding responses. Moreover, in process of responding to users, assistants also tend to learn from them by analysing their patterns and preferences.
